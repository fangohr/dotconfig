- choose keyboard shortcuts that work when OSX is used as the terminal. In particular the default shortcuts 
  CTRL - RIGHT and CTRL - LEFT are used on OSX already to move from one desktop to another
- instead, use CTRL - r (for right) and CTRL - l (for left)

- add a variety of emacs calls, or zile as a fast drop-in

- add bat as a file viewer
